Okay, so I just walked out of this movie called Deva. And, yeah, well, that was a ride. You know when you've just had a big meal and you're still trying to figure out if you're full or still hungry? That’s kind of how I feel right now, but with emotions and plot points instead of a cheeseburger.

First off, the visuals? Man, they hit like the first sip of coffee on a Monday morning. But then you're expecting some kind of sweet aftertaste, and it turns out they poured too much sugar and now you're just jittery and weirdly annoyed. The movie is like a kaleidoscope of colors that just keeps spinning, never really settling on something you can latch onto. Maybe it's trying to be too clever or maybe I’m just not smart enough at 10 PM to get it. 

And the plot twists? My brain feels like it's been through some kind of washing machine cycle. You know, tossed around, then pulled out only to realize — hey, there’s another stain left. Like, I get that they’re trying to surprise us, but at some point I'm just nodding like, “Sure man, whatever you say, who's even counting anymore?

> There's this one part that felt like they forced the characters to go through a rollercoaster and forgot to strap them in properly. Drama for the sake of drama! It's like the writers were playing Jenga but with emotions and decided to shake the table just because they felt like it. I guess it made for a thrilling game — err, movie. I mean... download the movie later, if that's your thing, just don't blame me if your brain feels like scrambled eggs afterward.

If I had to compare it to food, I'd say it was like trying a new dish at a fancy place. Presentation's beautiful, smells amazing, but halfway through you're wondering if roasted squid ink with a side of existential crisis was really the right choice for dinner. 

Oh, and here's something totally random — why did that one scene remind me of compiling code? Like literally just this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf(Deva knows...
);
    return 0;
}
```
No explanation. Sometimes it’s best not to question the black box of your mind.

So, in conclusion, the film was... it's something you experience more than just watch. Like you walk out feeling a bit more worn out, like you've been on a long road trip with that one friend who doesn't ever shut up about their 'crazy summer.' Brilliant yet tiring. Go watch the movie. Or don’t. I’m not your roadmap to cinematic enlightenment.
